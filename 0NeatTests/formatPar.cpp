//reformat 
/*Let's say you're on my team, and I've decided I'm a real stickler for code formatting. But I've got peculiar tastes, and one day I decide I want to have all parentheses stand out very clearly in your code.

So let's say you've got a set of source files in C, C++, or Java. Your choice. And I want you to modify them so that in each source file, every open- and close-paren has exactly one space character before and after it. If there is any other whitespace around the paren, it's collapsed into a single space character.

For instance, this code:
foo (bar ( new   Point(x, graph.getY())   ));

Would be modified to look like this:
foo ( bar ( new Point ( x, graph.getY ( ) ) ) ) ;*/
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int isPar(char x)
{
	return x=='('||x==')'?1:0;
}

int main()
{
string raw="foo (bar ( new   Point(x, graph.getY())   ));";
cout<<"Raw\t:\t"<<raw<<endl
	<<"ShouldBe:\tfoo ( bar ( new   Point ( x, graph.getY ( ) ) ) ) ;"<<endl;
cout<<"Result\t:\t";
int n=raw.length();
for (int i=0;i<n-1;i++)	{
	if (raw[i]!=' '&&isPar(raw[i+1])) {
		raw.insert(i+1," ");
		n++;
		i++;
		}
	if (isPar(raw[i])&&raw[i+1]!=' ') {
		raw.insert(i+1," ");
		n++;
		i++;
		}
	}
for(int i=0;i<raw.length();i++) {
	cout<<raw[i];
	int Nspace=0;
	while(raw[i]==' ') {
		Nspace++;
		i++;
		}
		if (!isPar(raw[i]))	{
			for(int j=0;j<Nspace-1;j++)
			cout<<' ';
			}
		if (Nspace)
			cout<<raw[i];
	}
cout<<endl;
}
